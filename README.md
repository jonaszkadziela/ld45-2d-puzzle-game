# Ludum Dare 45 Entry: "No Stone Uncrumbled" by Jonasz Kądziela & Artur Jaszczak
### _Also known as "No Stone Unturned"_

## About the game:
***No Stone Uncrumbled*** is a number-based puzzle game.
Take control of the purple kobold living underground and help him get enough boulders to reach the target.
You can add, subtract, divide and multiply, but be careful - you have to use your strength to move the rocks.
Plan your route accordingly to avoid running out of energy and don't take too long of a route - the boulders crumble and get smaller the more you push them!

### Team roles:
* Jonasz Kądziela - Programming :computer: & Graphics Design :art:
* Artur "ShadAcinonyx" Jaszczak - Audio :musical_note: & Graphics Design :art:

## How to play?
* At the beginning of each round, the _Target_ number is randomly generated from a specific range.
* Every round you start with nothing, number 0, and your goal is to get as close as possible to the _Target_ number.
* _Energy_ is limited and dictates how much you can move. If you run out of _Energy_, you faint - game over.
* After each round you will receive a reward consisting of more _Energy_ and _Money_. The closer your number was to the _Target_ number the more _Energy_ you will get. Resolving the puzzle quickly will give you bonus money.

## Pro tips:
* _Sandstone_ (brown rock) is lighter than _Granite_ (grey rock), however it crumbles more easily.

## Controls:

### Movement
* **W** or **Up Arrow** - move forward
* **S** or **Down Arrow** - move backward
* **A** or **Left Arrow** - move to the left
* **D** or **Right Arrow** - move to the right

**We do really hope the game isn't too difficult or straight up boring. Time was tight and playtesting short - balance might be off. There are also some of the features that we couldn't implement before the end of the Jam** :sweat_smile:
